Simple WordPress plugin that adds a "Playlist" block to the Gutenberg editor.

== Description ==

# Playlists Blocks for the Gutenberg Editor
Simple WordPress plugin that adds a "Playlist" block to the Gutenberg editor. It uses the built in [[playlist] shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Playlist_Shortcode).

## Usage
Add the block to any post. By default, it will show all video or audio files attached to the post.

### Tracks
Click the "Select Attachments" button to add files from the media library. These will show instead of the attached media. You can reorder items by dragging them from the bottom.

### Order
Order comes  "RANDOM". Note that ASC and DESC only work with attached media, and not when used in conjunction with Tracks.

### Style
Can be set to Light or Dark.

### Hide
Here you can hide various elements from the playlist:
* Track List
* Track Numbers
* Images (Audio Only)
* Artists (Audio Only)
